# Features

* Open a folder of images
* Tiling format
* loads on scroll
* area for observing in detail a selected image

# Demonstration

<img width="600" height="400" src="./example.gif" alt="Demonstration GIF">


# Reason

It's just a better way to navigate my "mc inspi" folder which stands for 
"minecraft inspiration" than just browsing my file explorer.
Just scroll, click on something I like, zoom in, out etc.

This is largely AI slop btw, but realizing I needed to create columns and to 
fill images in them iteratively to get a nice tiling was my own realization and 
nowhere properly explained in forums. Realizing that the html for yandex images
had a {row:0, col:0} abstraction in the code made me understand. The rest is copilot
turning my commands into reality.

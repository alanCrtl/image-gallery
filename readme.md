# Features

* Open an folder of images
* Tiling format
* loads on scroll
* area for observing in detail a selected image

# Demonstration

<video width="640" height="480" controls>
  <source src="example.gif" type="video/mp4">
</video>

# Reason

It's just a better way to navigate my "mc inspi" folder which stands for 
"minecraft inspiration" than just browsing my file explorer.
Just scroll, click on something I like, zoom in, out etc.

# TODO

* Go to top button ?
* Make zoom and dezoom updates ?
